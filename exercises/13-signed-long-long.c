/* Show that if the minimal and maximal values for signed long long have similar properties, the smallest
integer value for the platform canâ€™t be written as a combination of one literal with a minus sign. 

Output :
Min: -9223372036854775808
Combination: -9223372036854775808
-
-
-
As seen in the output, the combination is equal to the minimum value itself and cannot be expressed differently. 
Therefore, the smallest integer value for the platform (-9223372036854775808) cannot be written as a combination of one literal with a minus sign.
